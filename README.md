# Hunter Gatherers
## GovHack 2034

We’re team Hunter-Gatherers, from Launceston, and we’re here to tell you about our well-being and connectedness app, Gather.

Gather was inspired by the social connection domain in the ACT’s Wellbeing Framework, our work in this domain could make a difference by examining data around both social connection and how it improves wellbeing.

Gather is an app informed by research and aims to:
- improve social connection of individuals
- validate and contribute to "action research" with the ACT's Wellbeing Framework
- provide community groups and government bodies with data for improving their community events.
