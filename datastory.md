# Data Story
 
Gather was inspired by the social connection domain in the ACTâ€™s Wellbeing Framework, our work in this domain could make a difference by examining  data around both social connection and how it improves wellbeing.

Gather is an app informed by research and aims to:
- improve social connection of individuals
- validate and contribute to "action research" with the ACT's Wellbeing Framework
- provide community groups and government bodies with data for improving their community events.
